        <h1 style="margin-left: 520px;">Database</h1>
        <p>A database is one of the essential components for many applications and is used for storing a series of data in a single set.</p> 
        <p>In other words, it is a group/package of information that is put in order so that it can be easily accessed, manage, and update.</p>
        <p>In a database, even the smallest portion of information becomes the data. <br>For example, a Student is a data, a roll number is a data, and the address is data, height, weight, marks everything is data.</p>
        <p>In brief, all the living and non-living objects in this world are data. In this chapter of the database, you will learn about the fundamental terminologies that are used in DBMS.</p>
